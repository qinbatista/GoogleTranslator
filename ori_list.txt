This game looks fun, let's check it out.
I was right, this game is fun. Let me get back to it...
Learned to knit so I could make <an> $clubname FC scarf.
Not sure what to do this weekend, I need advice from <staffname>.
Thinking about getting my hair cut to look more like <playername> <position>.
Started an argument about why $clubname FC are going to top the league next season.
Started an argument about why $clubname FC are going to top the league next season, and won it.
Had a dream about <playername> <position>. It's not weird.
I might get a dog and name it <staffname>.
Not going to book a holiday this year, we've got some Board Targets to achieve.
Could have sworn I saw <playername> <position> in the street yesterday.
Pretty sure I'll be getting called up as the <nation> coach soon.
Starting to develop a callous on my kicking thumb.
Couldn't sleep at all last night. Worried about <playername><s> <position> current form.
<nation> still haven't called. Maybe they've left a message.
I can remember <playername><s> <position> birthday, but forgot my own...
Might as well just turn up at the next <nation> game; they'll know who I am and why I'm there.
Have added "Manager at $clubname FC" to the 'hobbies' section of my CV.
Writing a strongly worded letter about the lack of $clubname FC games on terrestrial TV.
Have added "Manager at $clubname FC" to the 'previous employment' section of my CV.
Discovered how to officially rename my house, I now live at "$stadiumname".
Have added "Manager at $clubname FC" to the 'current employment' section of my CV.
On second thoughts I'm not even going to pick up if <nation> calls. I'm $clubname FC for life.
If I could get a waterproof phone I could keep playing in the shower.
Have thrown my CV away. As long as I'm managing $clubname FC I don't need another job.
Took a short break to watch a movie. I think <playername> <position> would have loved it.
I might get a discrete "$clubname FC" tattoo.
I might get <playername><s> <position> face tattooed on my back.
Have been asking strangers if they're ready to accept $clubname FC into their hearts.
<playername> <position> is my spirit animal.
If everyone could just get behind $clubname FC I think we could achieve world peace.
<staffname> is basically like family to me.
Changing my Last Will and Testament. All my possessions go to <staffname>.
When I die, chisel $clubname FC's win record onto my tombstone.
Starting to wish that more people were as helpful as <staffname>.
If $clubname FC were real, I'd buy a season ticket.
Checked online to see if I could buy a season ticket for $clubname FC. Just in case.
Designed my own season ticket for $clubname FC and printed it out. Feel better now.
Made up a song about <playername> <position> so I can chant it while I'm playing.
Struggling to remember how things were before $clubname FC.
The average age of the squad is $average_age, boss. I would suggest bringing in some fresh blood.
The average age of the squad is $average_age, boss. I would suggest bringing in one or two more experienced players.
The board will be reviewing our targets after the next match.
A number of players are concerned about their contracts.
A number of players are concerned their lack of development.
A number of players are concerned about your MANAGEMENT skills.
A number of players are concerned about the current team FORM. We need a win to boost the squad.
We are lacking $position cover at the moment.
The $position position is our weakest.
In my opinion we should be looking to upgrade our $facility as soon as possible.
The overall squad happiness is very low at the moment.
Don't forget that we have a vacant $stafftype position that needs filling.
I think our ticket prices are having a negative impact match attendance.
Our relationship with the $relationship is very low and requires your attention.
We may need to consider increasing the stadium capacity soon.
$playername is extremely unhappy. Maybe you should have a meeting to clear the air?
Our next fixture is against $clubname, why not top up on retries before the match!
We have a crucial cup game coming up against $clubname, why not top up on retries before the match!
We have an important game coming up against $clubname in the $compname, why not top up on retries before the match!
Hey Boss, Everything seems to be going ok at the moment.
We should think about raising ticket prices.
You might want to think about lowering ticket prices.
The team are looking pretty tired, maybe we should give them some energy cards.

SKILL cards can be applied to a player to improve a SKILL. This player would benefit from improving his DRIBBLING. ¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬TAP AND HOLD ON THE CARD, THEN DRAG IT ONTO HIM TO APPLY IT¬s¬.
Boss, let's use the half-time team-talk card.
Boss, the club is near the bottom of the league with not many games of the season left. Things are pretty desperate, but the board have scraped together $num to get you started.
Excellent! You still have some players out of position, but if you ever want me to choose the team just press ASSISTANT PICK. Try it now.
OK, these are the coaches currently available. Price is determined by STAR RATING and AGE. As coaches get older, their rating will decline. Browse the list and ¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬TAP ON ONE TO HIRE¬s¬.
One last thing boss... You can move the camera around to get a better view of the action. ¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬TOUCH ANYWHERE ON THE PITCH AND DRAG¬s¬ to rotate the camera. Pinch zooms in and out.
Player cards are automatically added to your squad. Other cards are added to your collection accessed via the button at the top of the screen.
You can check on your card collection here.
Better packs contain better players. The colour of the star on a player card represents quality: grey, bronze, silver, gold or black. The better the player, the better SKILL cards you'll need to improve him. 
The CLUB screen displays all kinds of stats about your club. This tab shows the state of your relationships. There are benefits to keeping them high and penalties if they fall too low!
Now we will view the effects of COACHING. Your coaches can focus their time on SKILLS, FITNESS or YOUTH.
STAR RATING determines the quality of COACHING CARDS generated: better coaches generate better cards. With more coaches and facilities we can produce youth players, scout targets or treat injured players.
We generated some ENERGY cards! These can be applied to tired players to give them more ENERGY just like we did with the SKILL card. 
PACE cards increase a player's top speed while STRENGTH cards increase a player's ability to ride challenges. Useful!
Let's complete your manager profile. Enter a name, set your gender and choose where you want to play. When you're happy, tap CONTINUE.
That's it boss! I'll let you get on with things on your own for a bit. I'll be back now and again to help out but you can always tap on the help icon on the header for additional guidance. Good luck!
That's the team ready boss! Let's head into the match!
You can agree the contract at any point through the negotiation. A failed negotiation will increase the cost of the contract, though.
Try increasing this coach's contract. Doing so increases how long the coach will stay at the club, but also increases the cost of the contract.
And lastly, the data chart's really useful for checking how the club performance is affecting relationships like fan happiness or board satisfaction. Hey! Someone wants to interview you!
Our keeper is currently injured so let's swap him with our sub keeper. ¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬TAP AND HOLD¬s¬ on the injured keeper, ¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬THEN DRAG¬s¬ the card on to the reserve keeper.
Keep going boss! Let's see if we can build on your good work in the second half!
Let's try stringing together a passing move. Remember, ¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬TAP ON A PLAYER TO PASS DIRECTLY TO HIM¬s¬.
That's it! Now, ¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬TAP IN FRONT OF A PLAYER TO MAKE HIM RUN ONTO THE BALL¬s¬.
You'll also get a breakdown of the finances. Home matches generate GATE RECEIPTS based on the ticket price and the number sold.
Wow! What a half boss!|The players are really turning it on for you! It looks like you're totally comfortable with the match controls.
With a FITNESS CENTRE, we can hire a coach to improve the physical condition of our players. Let's do that now.
Great!|Having a coach in the fitness centre means we'll start generating FITNESS CARDS that you can use to improve players.
This is the FORMATION screen. Tap and hold on a player card, then drag to swap it with other player cards or move it to a new position on the field.
We generated a SKILL card! Let's go to the SQUAD screen and improve a player's SKILL.
Almost there boss, but before I go, let's take a quick look at the shop.
Now let's try negotiating the contract: use the higher or lower buttons to guess higher or lower than the shirt number shown: numbers range from 1-11. Tap AGREE when you're happy. Remember, failed negotiations increase the price of the contract!
This team's got a pretty weak defence boss. It might be worth telling the team to attack more.
You're doing really well boss, but I would suggest we upgrade the FITNESS CENTRE as soon as possible.
Great game boss! After each match you will get a breakdown of what effects the result had on your relationships.
There's plenty to do, but let's jump straight into a game after that great training session. Every game is important at the bottom of the table, so let's see if we can get a result.
OK boss, it's time to play another game!
Great work boss. Having a coach in the FITNESS CENTRE generates PACE and STRENGTH cards for your players. Let's play another game!
This is the match screen boss. It will show you the progress of the game. When the match starts, we'll cut to moments on the pitch where the action will be on you. ¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬TAP PLAY TO START!¬s¬
Card packs normally cost money boss, but as this is your first time you can have this one for free!
This tab shows you an overview of your club and all your facilities.
While this tab shows you your SPONSORS. Upgrading your CLUB STORE is a good way of gaining extra sponsors.... and extra income!
Coaches can't generate cards after every match: they have a cooldown. So when that happens, try resting your players instead! You won't get any SKILL cards, but will get ENERGY cards you can use on tired players.
Now ¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬TAP AND HOLD ON THE TEAM TALK CARD AND DRAG IT ONTO THE TEAM¬s¬ to give your team a motivational speech!
Now see if you can beat the keeper! Remember, ¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬PULL BACK AND AIM THE ARROW¬s¬ to aim your shot.
When you've got space to run into, try dribbling. ¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬TOUCH THE PLAYER WITH THE BALL AND DRAG BACK UNTIL HE STARTS RUNNING¬s¬.
Always try to pass to unmarked players. Aiming your pass in front of players makes them run onto the ball. ¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬TAP ON THE SPACE IN FRONT OF THE PLAYER.¬s¬
It's your first chance to score! To beat the keeper, aim for a corner of the goal and ¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬PULL BACK UNTIL THE ARROW TURNS RED¬s¬ for maximum power!
We can beat the defensive line with a well-timed run!  ¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬DRAW A PATH FROM THE PLAYER¬s¬ between the defenders and towards the goal.
That's it! Now ¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬TAP ON THE PATH¬s¬ to execute a defence-splitting pass.
Perfect! Now ¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬PULL BACK AND AIM THE ARROW¬s¬ towards a corner of the goal to beat the keeper.
Tackling next! There's two types of tackle: a slide tackle and a block tackle. We're going to try a block tackle. Because you don't have the ball, you have to drag towards the player you want to tackle.  
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬DRAG AN ARROW FROM YOUR PLAYER TO THE PLAYER WITH THE BALL AND RELEASE BEFORE THE ARROW TURNS RED¬s¬ to perform the block tackle.
That's all of the match controls, boss. Try to put moves together by ¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬TAPPING ON TEAM-MATES TO PASS¬s¬, ¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬DRAGGING BACK TO DRIBBLE¬s¬ and ¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬DRAGGING BACK TO SHOOT¬s¬. Good luck!
The team looks in pretty good shape, boss. Let's go to the game.
Good work boss! We can use that team-talk card in our next match to give our team a boost at half-time.
Try to spot which of the six phrases go green and then tap on them when they get mixed up. The more you get, the more energy the team get.
Training players will make them more effective. However, it also consumes energy. Use the ASSISTANT PICK to swap the player out and let him recover.
Good work boss!|That was a great training session. You're ready to enter the exciting world of football management!
Excellent! Now, the next trial is about dribbling. ¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬TOUCH THE PLAYER WITH THE BALL AND DRAG BACK¬s¬ to make him run in a direction: he will start running when the arrow turns green.
That's it! Dribble up the screen and across the blue line.
The team are waiting for your first training session, boss! Let's get started!
Getting players to pass to each other is easy. Simply ¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬TAP ON A PLAYER¬s¬ who doesn't have the ball.
Excellent! Now to get your team to pass into space. ¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬TAP ON AN AREA¬s¬ near another player: the nearest player will run onto the ball.
Good! You can also set players to make runs. ¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬DRAW A PATH¬s¬ from a player who doesn't have the ball.
That's it! Now, ¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬TAP SOMEWHERE ON THE PATH¬s¬ to pass the ball for the player to run onto.
Perfect! This next trial is about shooting. ¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬TOUCH THE PLAYER WITH THE BALL AND DRAG BACK¬s¬ towards the goal. Release your shot any time; the further back you drag, the more powerful it will be.
Great! Now, ¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬TAP THE CENTRE OF THE BALL¬s¬ to kick it straight or on either side to add curl!
As you hire new people they will appear on this screen. At the moment we only have a SKILLS coach, so let's change that! ¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬TAP THE HIRE COACH BUTTON¬s¬.
Before the next match let's take a look at the CLUB screen. ¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬TAP THE CLUB BUTTON¬s¬ now.

¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬WELCOME TO THE HELP FILES¬s¬ ||Need help with something? Use the scrolling list of topics on the right to choose the subject you want help with, and hopefully I'll be able to give you the answers you're looking for.
PASS TO PLAYER
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬PASSING TO A PLAYER¬s¬ ||When your team are in possession of the ball, tapping on one of your players passes to them. The accuracy of the pass is affected by the quality of the pitch and the happiness of the squad.
PASS TO SPACE
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬PASSING TO SPACE¬s¬ ||When your team are in possession of the ball, tapping on the pitch passes to that spot. The accuracy of the pass is affected by the quality of the pitch and the happiness of the squad.
SETTING RUNS
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬SETTING RUNS¬s¬ ||When your team are in possession of the ball, touch on a player and drag the path you want them to run.
DRIBBLING
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬DRIBBLING¬s¬ ||Touch the player in possession of the ball and drag back until an arrow appears. When the arrow turns green, the player will start dribbling the ball. The higher the player's PACE, the faster he'll move, the higher his DRIBBLING, the closer his control. Releasing when the arrow is extended will make the player shoot. If you want to stop dribbling without shooting, let the arrow shrink until it disappears, then release.
SHOOTING
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬SHOOTING¬s¬ ||Touch the player in possession of the ball and drag back until an arrow appears. The direction of the arrow indicates the direction of the shot, while the colour and length of the arrow indicates shot power. The higher a player's STRENGTH, the more powerful shots they can make.
CURL THE BALL
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬CURLING & LOFTING THE BALL¬s¬ ||When you've chosen shot power and direction, you get to strike the ball. Tapping in the centre of the ball kicks it straight. Tapping the bottom of the ball lofts it, while tapping on the left or right of the ball curls it. The higher a player's TECHNIQUE, the more curl they can apply to the ball.
BLOCK TACKLES
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬BLOCK TACKLING¬s¬ ||When the opposition have the ball, touch on a player and drag him towards the player with the ball. You can hold on screen and adjust your player's direction. If your player intercepts the player with the ball while the arrow is grey, he will perform a block tackle. The higher a player's TACKLING, the quicker they're able to perform a block tackle.
SLIDE TACKLES
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬SLIDE TACKLING¬s¬ ||When the opposition have the ball, touch on a player and drag him towards the player with the ball. Release the screen when the arrow turns red and your player will perform a slide tackle. Tackling an opponent from behind will result in a foul. The higher a player's TACKLING, the quicker and further they're able to perform a slide tackle.
FREE KICKS
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬FREE KICKS, CORNERS & PENALTIES¬s¬ ||If one of your players is fouled, you will get a free kick. If one of your players is fouled inside the penalty box, you will be awarded a penalty. If the opposition kicks the ball out of play behind the goal, you'll be awarded a corner. You're not able to dribble from any of these chances: play must be restarted with a kick.
THE CAMERA
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬CAMERA CONTROLS¬s¬ ||Touch anywhere on the screen (avoiding players) and drag to rotate and tilt the camera. The camera can be zoomed in or out by tapping and holding two fingers anywhere on screen and pinching.
RETRIES
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬RETRYING A CHANCE¬s¬ ||If you fail a chance, you may retry it. You start every game with one free retry. You can gain extra retries by either watching adverts when given the opportunity or by purchasing the retry pack from the shop.
WORK-RATE
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬CHANGING WORK-RATE¬s¬ ||Increasing your team's work-rate will strengthen your team's defensive abilities and increases the number of chances you'll get to score in a match, but it will also make your team tire more quickly. Decreasing your team's work-rate saves energy but will weaken your defence and decreases the number of chances you'll get to score.
FOCUS
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬CHANGING FOCUS¬s¬ ||DEFEND decreases your chances of conceding, but your match chances start nearer your own goal. COUNTER decreases your chance of conceding, means your match chances are more likely to be break-aways, but consumes more energy. ATTACK increases your chances of conceding but your match chances start nearer the opposition goal. DIRECT reduces midfield strength, but most of your match chances start near the opposition goal.
SUBSTITUTIONS
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬MAKING SUBSTITUTIONS¬s¬ ||To make a substitution during a match, tap the TACTICS button, then simply drag a player from your substitutes onto the player you want to replace. When you're happy with your changes, tap the RESUME button. You can make up to three substitutions during a match.
TEAM TALKS
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬GIVING A TEAM TALK¬s¬ ||If your team are tired at halftime, it can be a good idea to give them a team talk. Tap the TACTICS button, select the CARDS tab and drag a TEAMTALK card onto your team. You'll then see a number of phrases: remember which phrases turn green! Then, when they all turn grey and shuffle positions, tap on as many of the phrases that were green as you can remember before the clock counts down. Your team will get an energy boost for every green phrase you correctly select.
ASSISTANT HELP
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬ASSISTANT COMMENTS¬s¬ ||During a match you may notice comments from your assistant coach. He can provide useful insights into how your team are faring on the pitch and recommendations about how to improve your team's performance. It's worth listening to him.
STADIUM
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬UPGRADING YOUR STADIUM¬s¬ ||Tap on any of your stands to open the upgrade menu. Upgrading your stands will increase the seating capacity and earning potential. To upgrade to the top stadium, you'll also need to upgrade the corner stands.
PITCH
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬UPGRADING YOUR PITCH¬s¬ ||Tap on your pitch to open the upgrade menu. Upgrading your pitch reduces the amount of energy your players use during a match, reduces their chance of injury as well as increasing the accuracy of your team's passes.
TRAINING GROUND
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬UPGRADING YOUR TRAINING GROUND¬s¬ ||Tap on your training ground to open the upgrade menu. Upgrading your training ground reduces the cooldown on SKILL cards, meaning you can generate SKILL cards more often after matches.
FITNESS CENTRE
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬UPGRADING YOUR FITNESS CENTRE¬s¬ ||Tap on your fitness centre to open the upgrade menu. Upgrading your fitness centre reduces the cooldown on FITNESS cards, meaning you can generate FITNESS cards more often after matches.
YOUTH ACADEMY
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬UPGRADING YOUR YOUTH ACADEMY¬s¬ ||Tap on your youth academy to open the upgrade menu. Upgrading your youth academy reduces the cooldown on YOUTH PLAYERS, meaning you can generate new YOUTH PLAYERS more often after matches.
MEDICAL UNIT
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬UPGRADING YOUR MEDICAL UNIT¬s¬ ||Tap on your medical unit to open the upgrade menu. Upgrading your medical unit increases the power of TREATMENT cards, meaning you can reduce the length of injuries by more matches.
SCOUT'S OFFICE
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬UPGRADING YOUR SCOUT'S OFFICE¬s¬ ||Tap on your scout's office to open the upgrade menu. Upgrading your scout's office reduces the cooldown on scouting players, meaning you can scout players more often after matches. Scouted players are added to the SCOUTED PLAYERS tab on the Search Screen and are cheaper to purchase than un-scouted players.
CLUB STORE
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬UPGRADING YOUR CLUB STORE¬s¬ ||Tap on your club store to open the upgrade menu. Upgrading your club store not only increases store sales after every match but also unlocks the ability to sign a second and third SPONSOR.
LEAGUE RULES
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬LEAGUE RULES¬s¬ ||Your team will be awarded three points for a win, one point for a draw and no points for a loss. If teams are tied on points, goal difference, then goals scored are used to determine league position.
PROMOTION
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬GETTING PROMOTED OR RELEGATED¬s¬ ||To be automatically promoted to a higher division at the end of a season, your team must typically finish in first place. Automatic promotion places have a green stripe on the left edge. If your team misses automatic promotion, you can still go up a division via play-off games. Play-off places have a yellow stripe on the left edge. If your team finishes at or near the bottom of the division, you may be relegated to the division below. Relegation places have a red stripe on the left edge.
CUPS
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬CUP COMPETITIONS¬s¬ ||Cup competitions are typically knock-out tournaments. While it's possible you may face teams from a higher or lower division in a cup, it's well worth trying to progress as far as you can as the financial rewards get larger the further your team progresses.
FORMATIONS
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬CHANGING TEAM FORMATIONS¬s¬ ||Tap on the FORMATION tab to view the formations available to you. Choosing a more offensive formation will help you get more chances in a match while choosing a more defensive formation will reduce the chances of the opposition scoring against you. Initially it's a good idea to choose a formation that suits the players you have in your squad. If your formation isn't working well during a match, your assistant coach may prompt you to change it.
POSITIONS
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬PLAYER POSITIONS¬s¬ ||Every player has a position. You can make players more versatile by playing ADD SIDE cards on them. Players playing out of position are less effective: their rating flashes and is reduced until they're moved back into their proper position.
TEAM SELECTION
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬TEAM SELECTION¬s¬ ||It's a good idea to select a starting 11 with good energy levels and every player playing in their chosen position. If you'd rather let your assistant pick the team, simply press the ASSISTANT PICK button. Players will be selected based on position and fitness.
PLAYER QUALITY
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬PLAYER QUALITY & POTENTIAL¬s¬ ||Player ratings go from 1-100. The colour of the star reflects their quality also: players go from grey, through bronze, silver and gold to black. A player's rating can be improved by playing either SKILL or FITNESS cards on them that are equal to or better than their quality. For example, a bronze player can only be improved with a bronze or better SKILL or FITNESS card. To see a player's maximum potential, tap on a player card to open the player dialog. A player's rating starts to degrade as they near retirement age.
TRAITS
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬PLAYER TRAITS¬s¬ ||Some players have traits, indicated by an icon on the bottom right corner of the player's card. Tap on a player card to open the player dialog and view what the trait is. You'll need to have upgraded your medical unit to level 2 in order to see your squad's traits and to level 3 to see those of other players. Traits can have either positive or negative effects: watch the match commentary for the effects of player traits during matches. Some traits can affect other players, indicated by a + icon on the affected player card. Tap on the player card and view skills to see what the effect is.
PLAYER CONCERNS
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬PLAYER CONCERNS¬s¬ ||To view a player's concerns, tap on a player card to open the player dialog. If a player has concerns, they will not only look less happy, but will also perform less effectively during matches. Typically players are concerned about team form, a lack of training, their contract, or not being selected for the first team.
CONTRACTS
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬PLAYER CONTRACTS¬s¬ ||You'll get a warning about expiring player contracts on the Message Screen. A player's contract can be extended by either playing a CONTRACT card on the player, or by tapping on a player card to open the player dialog. Select the ACTIONS tab and tap on the RENEW CONTRACT button to open contract negotiations.
PLAYER RETIREMENT
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬PLAYER RETIREMENT¬s¬ ||Players retire anywhere from age 35 onwards. A retiring player has a grey energy icon on their player card. You cannot sign or renew the contract of a player retiring in the current season. A player's rating starts to degrade as they near retirement age.
BUYING PLAYERS
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬BUYING & SELLING PLAYERS¬s¬ ||Players can be purchased by tapping on their player card, selecting the ACTION tab and tapping the MAKE OFFER button. The best way to search for players is the Search Screen (the magnifying glass icon on the top bar) where you to filter players by position, age or rating. You can only buy players during the transfer window, the exceptions being free agents that your scout finds and premium players purchased from the Shop. Players can be sold by tapping on their player card, selecting the ACTION tab and tapping the AUCTION PLAYER button.
INJURIES
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬INJURIES¬s¬ ||An injured player is shown as flashing and with a red outline around their card. You can't field an injured player for a match. Play TREATMENT cards on an injured player to decrease the length of their injury.
SUSPENSIONS
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬SUSPENSIONS¬s¬ ||A suspended player is shown as flashing and with a red outline around their card. You can't field a suspended player for a match. Play APPEAL cards on a suspended player to decrease the length of their suspension.
SQUAD LIMIT
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬SQUAD LIMIT¬s¬ ||You can sign players up to your squad limit, at which point you'll no longer be able to sign players until you sell or release other players. The exception to this rule is players purchased from packs: these players do not count towards the normal squad limit at the time of purchase.
TEAM RATING
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬TEAM RATING¬s¬ ||Your team rating is shown at the bottom right corner of your team selection. This is a value based on the average rating of all the players in your starting 11. Obviously the higher your team rating, the more likely you are to win games.
TEAM HAPPINESS
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬TEAM HAPPINESS¬s¬ ||Your team happiness is shown at the bottom right corner of your team selection. This is a value based on the average happiness of all the players in your starting 11. The happier your team, the better they'll play.
TEAM ENERGY
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬TEAM ENERGY¬s¬ ||Your team energy is shown at the bottom right corner of your team selection. This is a value based on the average energy of all the players in your starting 11. The more energy your team has, the fewer chances they give the opposition and the less chance they have of getting injured.
ROOKIES
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬ROOKIE PLAYERS¬s¬ ||Young players who haven't made many appearances for the team are more likely to make mistakes and give up chances to the opposition. It's sensible to introduce rookie players late in a game when the result is already assured. Rookie players can be identified by the blue energy flash icon on their player card.
HIRING STAFF
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬HIRING & FIRING STAFF¬s¬ ||When you build a facility, you'll need to hire staff to start generating cards from that facility. Tapping on the HIRE STAFF button brings up a list of available coaches. A coach's rating indicates how good that coach is on a scale of 1-100. The colour of the star reflects their quality also: coaches go from grey, through bronze, silver and gold to black. Coaches with a higher rating generate higher rated cards. You can fire coaching staff by tapping on a coach card to open the coach dialog. Select the ACTIONS tab and tap on the FIRE COACH button. Firing staff may upset players in your squad.
IMPROVING STAFF
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬IMPROVING STAFF¬s¬ ||A coach's rating can be improved by playing an appropriate COACHING card on them that's equal to or better than their quality. For example, a bronze coach can only be improved with a bronze or better COACHING card.
STAFF RETIREMENT
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬STAFF RETIREMENT¬s¬ ||Coaches retire anywhere from age 60 onwards. You cannot sign or renew the contract of a coach retiring in the current season. A coach's rating starts to degrade as they near retirement age.
SKILLS COACH
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬SKILLS COACH¬s¬ ||Skills coaches generate SKILL cards after matches. These include cards that improve TACKLING, TECHNIQUE, DRIBBLING, ADD SIDE, HANDLING, AGILITY and REFLEXES. The higher your skill coach's rating, the higher the quality of cards which are generated.
FITNESS COACH
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬FITNESS COACH¬s¬ ||Fitness coaches generate FITNESS cards after matches. These include cards that improve STRENGTH and PACE. The higher your fitness coach's rating, the higher the quality of cards which are generated.
YOUTH COACH
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬YOUTH COACH¬s¬ ||Youth coaches generate YOUTH PLAYERS after matches. The higher your youth coach's rating, the higher the quality of the YOUTH PLAYERS which are generated.
SCOUT
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬SCOUT¬s¬ ||Scouts generate transfer targets. These are added to your list of scouted players on the Search Screen. Scouted players are available for a lower transfer fee than they otherwise would be. Your scout may also find free agents for you: these players can be purchased even outside of the transfer window.
PHYSIO
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬PHYSIO¬s¬ ||Physios generate TREATMENT cards. Playing a TREATMENT card on an injured player reduces an injury by the number of games stated on the card. The higher the rating of your Physio, the higher the quality of TREATMENT cards which are generated.
THE BOARD
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬THE BOARD¬s¬ ||Your BOARD relationship is a reflection of how happy the BOARD are with your management of the club. You can request funds by tapping on the BOARD on the Club Screen, but if you do, two things happen. Firstly, your BOARD relationship goes down and secondly, the BOARD will increase the shareholder cut of your post-match earnings. If your BOARD relationship is low, they will not release funds when requested.
THE FANS
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬THE FANS¬s¬ ||Your FANS relationship is a reflection of how happy the FANS are with your management of the club. You can adjust ticket and club store prices by tapping on the FANS on the Club Screen, but  be careful, raise either too high and you could damage the FANS relationship and decrease attendance at your home games.
THE PRESS
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬THE PRESS¬s¬ ||Your PRESS relationship is a reflection of how favourably you're viewed in the PRESS. A high PRESS relationship can boost attendance at matches and increase the money you get from broadcasting.
THE SPONSORS
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬THE SPONSORS¬s¬ ||Your SPONSORS relationship is a reflection of how happy your SPONSORS are to be associated with the club.
DATA GRAPH
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬DATA GRAPH¬s¬ ||The data graph is helpful for analysing the effect your choices are having on the club. Tap any of the buttons on the right side of the screen to turn data points on or off.
RETRIES
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬PURCHASING RETRIES¬s¬ ||You'll always start each game with one retry, but if one's never enough, then purchasing a pack of retries is a great way of doubling your retries to two per match.
PURCHASING BUX
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬PURCHASING BUX¬s¬ ||It can be difficult and time-consuming saving up to improve your playing squad or upgrade your buildings. Purchasing Bux is the best way to supercharge your career and immediately boost your club's progress!
PURCHASING CARDS
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬PURCHASING CARD PACKS¬s¬ ||There's no better way of immediately improving your staff or playing squad than buying a card pack. The extra benefit of purchasing player packs is that they can add players to your squad even outside the transfer window and that they don't count towards your normal squad limit at the time of purchase. What are you waiting for?
GATE RECEIPTS
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬GATE RECEIPTS¬s¬||Gate receipts are based on match attendance multiplied by ticket prices. Increasing the capacity of your stands and gaining promotion to better divisions are good ways of increasing attendance. Ticket prices can be adjusted on the Club Screen. Be careful increasing your ticket price though: if it's too high it can dramatically lower attendance and damage your FANS relationship.
BROADCAST
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬BROADCAST EARNINGS¬s¬  ||Broadcast earnings are based on how strong a team you have and at what level your team are playing. Getting promotion to higher divisions and having a good PRESS relationship are the best ways to increase the money you earn from being shown on TV!
STORE SALES
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬CLUB STORE SALES¬s¬ ||Club store sales are based on how upgraded your store is and what you've set the prices to. Store prices can be adjusted on the Club Screen. Be careful increasing your store price though: if they're too high it can lower attendance and damage your FANS relationship.
WIN BONUS
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬WIN & GOAL BONUS¬s¬ ||Your win and goal bonus are decided by whichever SPONSOR you chose to sign with. Some SPONSORS have a high win bonus, while others have a high goal bonus. Choose a SPONSOR that suits your style of play to maximise your earnings.
SHAREHOLDER CUT
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬SHAREHOLDER CUT¬s¬ ||The club shareholders always take a cut of the post-match earnings. You can request funds from the BOARD on the Club Screen, but if you do, the BOARD will increase the shareholder cut of the post-match earnings.
MARKETING MANAGER
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬MARKETING MANAGER¬s¬ ||You can purchase a marketing manager from the Shop. A marketing manager increases your earnings from every match you play!
GENERATING CARDS
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬GENERATING CARDS¬s¬ ||Any facility that you've built and staffed can generate a card after a match. The higher the rating of the staff in the facility, the better the cards they'll produce.
COOLDOWNS
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬COOLDOWN MECHANICS¬s¬ ||Once you've generated a card, that facility goes on "cooldown" and is unavailable for a number of games. Both upgrading the facility and increasing the quality of staff in the facility reduces how long the "cooldown" is. If all your facilities are on "cooldown", you're still able to generate NRG cards to increase the energy levels of your squad.
TRANSFER WINDOW
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬THE TRANSFER WINDOW¬s¬ ||The transfer window is a period during which you're able to purchase players. Your assistant will inform you when the transfer window opens or is about to close. When the transfer window is closed, you're not allowed to purchase players, the exceptions to this rule being free agents that your scout finds and premium players purchased from the Shop.
PLAYER SEARCHES
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬SEARCHING FOR PLAYERS¬s¬ ||The easiest way to search for players is via the Search Screen, accessible via the magnifying glass icon on the top bar. This screen allows you to filter players by position, age, rating and whether or not they'd be interested in signing for your club.
SHORTLISTING
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬SHORTLISTING PLAYERS¬s¬ ||When you've found a player you're interested in buying and want to remember them for later, shortlisting is a useful feature. You can shortlist a player by tapping on the shortlist icon to the left of their portrait on either a player dialog or any player list, such as the one on the Search Screen. Shortlisted players can be viewed on the Search Screen by selecting the SHORTLISTED tab.
SCOUTED PLAYERS
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬SCOUTED PLAYERS¬s¬ ||When your scout scouts a player, he is added to the Scouted players list on the Search Screen. Scouted players can be viewed on the Search Screen by selecting the SCOUTED tab.
MANAGER XP
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬MANAGER XP & LEVEL¬s¬ ||The Manager Screen is accessed by tapping the silhouette of your manager in the top left corner of the screen. Your Manager Level is advanced by collecting Manager XP. Manager XP is earned by winning the Manager of the Month, successfully completing press conferences, winning matches and completing achievements. Your Manager Level is a measure of your standing within the world of New Star Manager!
ACHIEVEMENTS
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬ACHIEVEMENTS¬s¬ ||Achievements can be viewed on the ACHIEVEMENTS tab of the Manager Screen. Completing achievements earns you Manager XP which advances your Manager Level. Tapping on the CLAIM button on each completed achievement claims the XP for completing that achievement.
TROPHIES
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬TROPHIES¬s¬ ||You can view the trophies available to win on the TROPHIES tab of the Manager Screen. Those that you've won already are shown in colour.
REPLAYS
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬REPLAYS¬s¬ ||If you've saved any replays, they can be accessed via the REPLAYS tab on the Manager Screen. You can save up to 10 replays to your collection, any of which can be recorded and shared to the social media platform of your choice.
BOARD TARGETS
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬COMPLETING BOARD TARGETS¬s¬ ||Completing board targets has two great benefits. The first is that it keeps your BOARD relationship high: always useful if you want to request funds! The second is that it's a great way to boost not only your Bux balance but also your card collection. You can check on your board targets at any time by tapping on the target icon on the top bar.
INTERVIEWS
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬SUCCEEDING AT INTERVIEWS¬s¬ ||As the manager of a football club, there's always someone interested in what you've got to say. You'll be interviewed on a regular basis and the press will ask you testing questions: get them right and you'll be rewarded with cards, but get them wrong and your relationships will suffer!
DILEMMAS
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬MAKING TOUGH CHOICES¬s¬ ||You'll occasionally encounter dilemmas. Simply choose which reward is most valuable to you at that moment.
INCIDENTS
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬DEALING WITH INCIDENTS¬s¬ ||Sometimes a player's behaviour can cause problems. When these incidents occur, you'll be asked what action you'd like to take. You can CASH FINE the player which reduces their happiness; you can make them do extra TRAINING which reduces their energy; or you can IGNORE the incident which increases that player's happiness but reduces the happiness of any other players in your squad who don't like them. Keeping players happy reduces the chance of incidents occurring.
SCANDALS
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬DEALING WITH SCANDALS¬s¬ ||When scandals occur, you can CRITICISE the player, reducing their happiness and your BOARD & SPONSORS relationship. You can CASH FINE them, reducing their happiness and your FANS & SPONSORS relationships. You can make them do extra TRAINING which reduces their energy and your BOARD & FANS relationships. Or you can IGNORE the scandal which increases that player's happiness but reduces your BOARD, FANS & SPONSORS relationships. Keeping players happy reduces the chance of scandals occurring.
MESSAGES
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬UNDERSTANDING MESSAGES¬s¬ ||The Message Screen keeps a log of the messages you've received. Important messages that require action appear in the MESSAGES tab while player and club tweets appear in the SOCIAL tab. It's a good idea to check in on the Message Screen on a regular basis as it can help you keep track of things that need action and the issues that are unsettling your squad.
AWARDS
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬LEAGUE & CLUB AWARDS¬s¬ ||At the end of the season, you'll be shown a summary of awards from the league and your club including top scorer, top assists, player of the year, young player of the year, star player, and the player with most appearances.
CONTRACTS
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬CONTRACTS¬s¬ ||At the end of the season, you'll get an overview of staff and player contracts. You'll be shown who's retiring and the staff members and players with the least time remaining on their contracts.
FINANCES
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬FINANCES¬s¬ ||You'll be financially rewarded by the league at the end of the season. The size of the reward is based on your finishing position: the higher your team finishes, the bigger the reward.
MOVING LEAGUE!
¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬MOVING TO ANOTHER LEAGUE!¬s¬ ||Maybe you've got to the top of the league... maybe there's nothing left to win? Well, that's when you might get an offer to re-locate! If you accept the offer of starting a new franchise elsewhere, you'll have the opportunity to choose which league you'd like to play in. However, if you do choose to move, be warned that you'll be starting again from scratch: you won't take any Bux, players, staff or facilities with you. The only thing you'll be taking is your reputation!

I hope ¬b¬$playername¬s¬ goes on to do great things. Quality player.
Why have we let ¬b¬$playername¬s¬ go? We can't be that desperate for cash!
We've sold ¬b¬$playername¬s¬? What's going on with this club? ¬b¬#madness¬s¬
Letting ¬b¬$playername¬s¬ go confirms it. We are a selling club.

We were the better team and should have snatched it.
We were lucky to get a point.

It felt good to clinch it in extra time.
I'm glad we avoided the dreaded penalty shootout.
The lads kept going and clinched it in extra time.
We deserved that extra time winner!

My nerves are still jangling from the penalties though!
Once it went to penalties I knew we'd win.
Nice work with the penalties lads!
Penalty shootout kings!
Let's not leave it to penalties next time though!
The penalties were nerve wracking.
The penalty shootout was never in doubt!
Tremendous penalties from the lads!
Nerves of steel for the penalties.
Always nice to clinch it on penalties!
And with 10 men!

When tickets are this price the football better be good!
Ticket prices are through the roof ¬b¬$clubtwitter¬s¬.
¬b¬$clubtwitter¬s¬ are charging how much for a ticket?!
Ridiculous ticket pricing ¬b¬$clubtwitter¬s¬.

Let's hope the quality of football can match these ticket prices!
Tickets prices have been lowered! :)
Lower ticket prices! ¬b¬#woo¬s¬
Great news! With these prices I can bring the whole family to see $clubname FC!
The new ticket pricing is a bit better I suppose.
¬b¬$clubtwitter¬s¬ still too pricey!
Now I can afford a cup of tea AND a pie at the match.
Crikey! The store prices are a bit much!
How much for a replica shirt ¬b¬$clubtwitter¬s¬? Forget it.
Oi ¬b¬$managertwitter¬s¬! Sort out the club store prices!
How can they charge that much for ¬b¬$clubtwitter¬s¬ merch?
Store prices are a tad high! ¬b¬#ripoff¬s¬
I love the club but refuse to pay these store prices.
Ridiculous store prices ¬b¬$clubtwitter¬s¬.
I ain't paying that for the ¬b¬$clubtwitter¬s¬ scarf!
Wanted to buy my kid a replica shirt but not at these prices.
Saving up for a replica shirt. Maybe next season.

I can't believe ¬b¬$coachname¬s¬ has gone! The best physio I ever had.

What on earth? Physio ¬b¬$coachname¬s¬ has gone? ¬b¬#gutted¬s¬
I'm gonna miss physio ¬b¬$coachname¬s¬. Very well liked around here.
Physio ¬b¬$coachname¬s¬ has been sacked! Now I'm depressed.
The club let physio ¬b¬$coachname¬s¬ go! ¬b¬#shameful¬s¬
Good luck to physio ¬b¬$coachname¬s¬. I hope you'll find a club that respects you.

Not many physios like ¬b¬$coachname¬s¬ around. Always took care of us.
Farewell to physio ¬b¬$coachname¬s¬. Gone. Unbelievable. ¬b¬#sadface¬s¬
Sad to see scout ¬b¬$coachname¬s¬ go. A real professional.
Scout ¬b¬$coachname¬s¬ has gone? Hope a new club will appreciate such a talent.
I'm gonna miss scout ¬b¬$coachname¬s¬. Knew football inside and out.
Scout ¬b¬$coachname¬s¬ was the most knowledgeable expert I knew. Had notes about every player around!

Great performance from the lads. Pleased with my Star Man award.
Really pleased to get the Star Man award today. ¬b¬#proud¬s¬
¬b¬$managertwitter¬s¬ I really think I should be in the team. 
¬b¬$managertwitter¬s¬ I wanna play! Put me in the team!
¬b¬$managertwitter¬s¬ Why won't you let me play? I won't let you down!
¬b¬$managertwitter¬s¬ I deserve a chance. Put me in the 1st team!
¬b¬$managertwitter¬s¬ If you're not gonna pick me I may as well start looking for a new club.
¬b¬$managertwitter¬s¬ If you don't need me in the team I'll find a new club.
¬b¬$managertwitter¬s¬ I'm worried that I'm getting overlooked in training. 
¬b¬$managertwitter¬s¬ It has been months since you last helped me improve in training.
¬b¬$managertwitter¬s¬ I feel like I'm stagnating at this club, boss. 
¬b¬$managertwitter¬s¬ I want to improve my skills!
¬b¬$managertwitter¬s¬ I don't feel like I'm improving at this club.
¬b¬$managertwitter¬s¬ What's going on with the training?
¬b¬$managertwitter¬s¬ Do you think you could help me in training?
¬b¬$managertwitter¬s¬ I'm not improving at all lately.
¬b¬$managertwitter¬s¬ When are you going to single me out for training?
¬b¬$managertwitter¬s¬ I need to keep improving!
¬b¬$managertwitter¬s¬ Feeling let down. You haven't helped me to improve my skills lately.
¬b¬$managertwitter¬s¬ Can you help me out in training boss? 
¬b¬$managertwitter¬s¬ I want to improve my skills!
¬b¬$managertwitter¬s¬ When are you going to sort me out with extra training?
¬b¬$managertwitter¬s¬ Do you think you could spend some time training with me?
¬b¬$managertwitter¬s¬ Any chance of some extra training?
¬b¬$managertwitter¬s¬ I'd prefer to play in my natural position.
¬b¬$managertwitter¬s¬ I didn't enjoy playing out of position.
¬b¬$managertwitter¬s¬ I tried my best in that position.
Been training with the lads. Almost injury free!
Great news! I'll soon be back from injury. ¬b¬#dancing¬s¬
Doc gave me the all clear. Will be playing again soon!
This injury is really getting me down. Won't be fit for ages. ¬b¬#depressed¬s¬
Hate being injured. Could be out for $num matches! ¬b¬#sadface¬s¬
Wish I could train with the lads. Really depressed. ¬b¬#torture¬s¬
Can't wait to play again. Should be back in $num matches!
Can't wait to be injury free. Not long now!
Soon I'll be injury free and back in training! ¬b¬#wahoo¬s¬
Gutted with the result. Back to the training ground.
We need to regroup, work hard and get back to winning ways!
$opposingclubname deserved it but we must do better.
Great result for $opposingclubname but we were poor today.
We practically gift wrapped that for $opposingclubname.
Bad result but happy with my performance.
We can take some positives from today's game at least.
Disappointed with the performance today. Must try harder.
A bad day at the office.
We must dust ourselves off and go again.
Gutted for the fans. They deserve better.
Fans were our twelfth man but the team fell short today.
Can't believe we lost today. Undeserved.
Football eh? Funny old game.
Results like this are hard to take.
Can't believe I'm not even in the starting eleven. The boss hasn't got a clue. ¬b¬#fuming¬s¬
If you're not one of his favourites you don't get a game. ¬b¬#stayclassy¬s¬
What's the point in staying at this club if I never get a game. ¬b¬#notfair¬s¬
$clubname keep paying the wages and I keep warming the bench. ¬b¬#miserable¬s¬
Love the $clubname fans but those in charge don't know what they're doing. ¬b¬#jokeclub¬s¬
Desperate to leave this club now. No point in staying if I'm not playing.
Another game and still not picked. Want to play for a club that appreciates me. ¬b¬#unhappy¬s¬
Not sure what I need to do to get a game. I guess the boss has his favourites.
I guess I'll start looking for a new club. Need to play matches.
Feeling fit but not getting a game. What a joke.
I hardly ever see the boss in training.
I guess $clubname just aren't bothered about developing my skills. ¬b¬#sadtimes¬s¬
I keep getting overlooked in training. Boss has his favourites I guess.
Maybe one day the boss will single me out for one-to-one training.
Clearly I'm not special. The boss never picks me for extra training.
Feel like I'm stagnating at this club. I never learn anything in training.
I can't remember the last time I had a good training session. :(
One of these days the boss will pick me out for special training. ¬b¬#dreamon¬s¬
It's hard to stand by and watch other players getting special training at this club.
Feeling let down by the club. I don't seem to be developing my skills at all.
Not happy about playing out of position!
I would rather play in my preferred position!
Why can't I play in my preferred position? ¬b¬#makesnosense¬s¬
I'm sure most players would agree that playing out of position isn't much fun.
It's hard to deliver when you're played out of position.
It's hard to perform at your best if you're not in your natural position.
The ref was a disgrace today. ¬b¬#fuming¬s¬
Utter disgrace that the referee is allowed to officiate at this level. ¬b¬#sundayleague¬s¬
And they call him one of the best referees? That's a joke. ¬b¬#shakingmyhead¬s¬
Can't believe how bad the ref was today. Total clown. ¬b¬#disgrace¬s¬
Every decision given to $opposingclubname. What a joke. ¬b¬#bribed¬s¬
The officials were abysmal today. ¬b¬#furious¬s¬
Have to question the performance of the referee. ¬b¬#unfair¬s¬
I think linesman forgot his specs today. ¬b¬#idiot¬s¬
So many decisions went against us today. Poor referee.
I wonder how much $otherclubname paid the ref today?
Absolute shocker from the ref today. ¬b¬#imbecile¬s¬
Last chance saloon for ¬b¬$teammate¬s¬. ¬b¬#journeyman¬s¬
I hear $teammate is looking for a new club. ¬b¬#sundayleague¬s¬
Work hard, get a contract. It's simple ¬b¬$teammate¬s¬.
What does the future hold for ¬b¬$teammate¬s¬? Nobody knows.
It has been a good run, ¬b¬$teammate¬s¬. Bye!
Looks like ¬b¬$teammate¬s¬'s days are numbered.
¬b¬$teammate¬s¬ is always whining about training. ¬b¬#putasockinit¬s¬
If ¬b¬$teammate¬s¬ had any real potential he might improve.
Hey ¬b¬$teammate¬s¬. Impress the boss and you might get a game.
¬b¬$teammate¬s¬ should look at himself before complaining about training.
Hearing the usual complaints about training from ¬b¬$teammate¬s¬.
Work hard, get rewarded. ¬b¬$teammate¬s¬ has a lot to learn.
¬b¬$teammate¬s¬ giving it large in training again. ¬b¬#clogger¬s¬
¬b¬$teammate¬s¬ is the worst dressed player in the league. ¬b¬#110percent¬s¬
Have you seen ¬b¬$teammate¬s¬'s hair?!
Congrats to ¬b¬$teammate¬s¬ on winning the player of the year award. ¬b¬#ugliest¬s¬
¬b¬$teammate¬s¬ talking himself up in the dressing room as usual.
¬b¬$teammate¬s¬ needs to be a team player.
¬b¬$teammate¬s¬ letting the side down as usual.
Wow. Stunning performance from ¬b¬$teammate¬s¬. ¬b¬#imdying¬s¬
¬b¬$teammate¬s¬ playing at his peak right now. ¬b¬#sundayleague¬s¬
Simply not good enough from ¬b¬$teammate¬s¬.
¬b¬$teammate¬s¬ needs to up his game if he wants to play.
¬b¬$teammate¬s¬, you need to cut the chat and get to work.
Hey ¬b¬$teammate¬s¬. Work a bit harder and you might get a game. ¬b¬#dreamon¬s¬
If ¬b¬$teammate¬s¬'s legs worked as hard as his mouth he might get picked.
Some players need to earn their place. I'm looking at you ¬b¬$teammate¬s¬.
Same old story from ¬b¬$teammate¬s¬. ¬b¬#pickmepickme¬s¬
¬b¬$managertwitter¬s¬ well that was a total waste of time!
¬b¬$managertwitter¬s¬ so what was the point in that?
Contract discussions are going really well. Not!
¬b¬$managertwitter¬s¬ I thought you were serious about renewing my contract. :(
I thought this club valued me. Maybe not...
We did it! ¬b¬#cupwinners¬s¬
What an achievement! Well done lads!
We won the cup!
Cup winners! So proud of the lads.
I knew we could do it. ¬b¬#cupwinners¬s¬

Once we have a FITNESS centre and a YOUTH academy you will also be able to assign coaches to different disciplines.
Great! We'll both get to work on the training ground and start generating SKILL CARDS that you can use to improve players.
You can negotiate contracts with players or staff, but for now, let's just get this coach signed up.
Boss, now that you've settled in, the BOARD have set some targets for you. Completing these tasks will keep them happy!
We generated a COACHING card! ¬#A61214FF¬¬o:#A61214FF¬TAP ON THE CARD TO REVEAL IT!¬s¬
Lastly, choose where you want to play. Scroll the continent or country to change them. When you're done, tap CONTINUE.
Here you will be able to view some basic club stats and set ticket prices. Low prices will please the fans and help fill the stadium but won't necessarily generate the most income.
Great game boss! After each match you will get a breakdown of the finances. Home matches will generate GATE RECEIPTS depending on the ticket price and the number sold.
Excellent! Now that we have a training ground we can hire another coach. Open up the STAFF screen to hire a new coach.
We should offer $name a longer contract with the club.
New Star FC have just sacked their manager! They've been down on their luck recently and believe you could be the manager they need to turn things around.
Our left midfielder's pretty tired from his extra training. Tired players don't play as well: let's bring on one of the subs.
Here we can see more specific player details like skills, stats and concerns.
You can always retry a chance if it goes wrong. You only have one free retry a match. You can get more by watching ads or buying a pack from the shop!

Your assistant and coaches can be assigned to work on the Training Ground, Fitness Centre or Youth Academy. If a coach is assigned to General coaching then he will split his time between all 3 facilities.
Working in the FITNESS CENTRE will generate FITNESS points that can be used to improve a player's FITNESS level.
These numbers numbers represent the coach's ability in each area of coaching. The higher the number the faster they work. If assigned to General coaching then their abilities will be divided by 3.
These bars represent how much progress your coaches have made so far. Working on the TRAINING GROUND will generate SKILL points that can be used to improve a player's SKILL level.
If you focus on YOUTH then a new young player will graduate from the YOUTH ACADEMY once the bar is full. You will then need to make the decision to sign or release the youth player.
This button will attempt to automatically select the best team for your formation.
Once you are happy with your team formation press CONFIRM.||If you made a mistake use the CANCEL button to undo any changes.

TEAMWORK POINTS can be used to improve a player's HAPPINESS. An unhappy player won't play to his full potential and angry players are more likely to get booked or sent off during a match.

You can hire coaches who along with your assistant will train your players. If you want to fire a member of staff you will need to pay compensation.
You can assign your coaches specific roles here or head over to the coaching screen for more detail.
You will need to hire a scout if you want to purchase new players. Scouts will present players for your evaluation.
Your assistant and coaches all have ratings for SKILL, FITNESS and YOUTH. These ratings determine how quickly they generate coaching points or develop youth academy players.
This is a list of available staff. Pay close attention to their abilities and signing fee, and bear in mind that abilities decline steadily after the age of 50. All staff retire at the age of 65.

The $facility is under construction at the moment, boss, so we might see reduced attendance figures until it's finished.
Some of the stands are under construction at the moment, boss, so we might see reduced attendance figures until they're finished.
All of the stands are under construction, boss. The board will not be happy at the lack of gate receipts.
We have lots of capacity in the stands but the squad doesn't have enough star power to attract the fans to fill it. Maybe we should look at getting in some higher rated players.
The only thing stopping us from packing the stands is the FANS themselves. Let's prioritise the FANS and get those gate receipts up!
The FANS aren't happy with the ticket prices at the moment, and it's affecting ticket sales. We might need to review the pricing to make sure it's balanced.
There wasn't much of a crowd in attendance. It seems that with the lack of PRESS attention, people are staying away.
